#What is radioreddit-cli?#
radioreddit-cli is a Python script that can be used to listen to RadioReddit.com streams from the command line. There is also a very simple and barebone GUI version using Yad included.

#Usage#

Command Line
> python radioreddit-cli.py indie

GUI
> radioeddit-gui.sh

#Available Streams#

* main
* random
* rock
* metal
* indie

If you run the script without a stream name, it defaults to "main".

#Requirements#
You only need "mplayer" to use radioreddit-cli.
For the GUI version you need Yad as well (available for all good distros).
